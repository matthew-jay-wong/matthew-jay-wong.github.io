# Sports

Welcome to my sports corner. Here you'll find my [thoughts](/blog/tags/sports) on the games I follow, weekly
reflections on what I've
watched, and my approach to being an intentional sports fan. From motorsport to hockey, football to baseball—these
are the games that matter to me.

## How I Enjoy Sports

I love watching sports, but I also want to be intentional about how I spend my time. Whether it's watching live
games, catching up on highlights, or consuming sports commentary, the hours add up quickly when you're following
multiple leagues. To enjoy sports sustainably while leaving room for other priorities—fitness, career, personal
growth—I've established clear boundaries.

Let's start with the reality: live sports are a significant time commitment.

| Sport    | Time      |
|----------|-----------|
| Football | 2.5h - 3h |
| Baseball | 3h1 - 4h   |
| Hockey   | 2h - 2.5h |

Add in pre-game shows, post-game analysis, podcasts, and sports talk radio, and you can easily spend 15-20 hours a
week on sports content alone. That's why I've created a framework that lets me stay connected to the games I love
without letting them consume my life.

### My Framework

**Live Games**
* One live game per week maximum
* Weekend games only (exceptions for finals and playoffs)
* If the game is on a Sunday, then it will be an early/late afternoon slot to protect my weeknight routine

**Content Consumption**
* No sports commentary or podcasts during the week—I form my own opinions
* Highlights only during treadmill workouts (30-45 minutes, 3-4 games)
* No pre/post-game shows to avoid the content spiral

**Reflection & Planning**
* One hour every Tuesday to journal about the previous week's games
* Review my live game choice and plan next week's viewing
* Early-week perspective before the next round of games begins

These boundaries help me maintain a healthy relationship with sports fandom—staying engaged and passionate without
sacrificing the other pursuits that make life fulfilling.
